# NecoLectures
This repository consist of my Necati Ergin's C++ lesson's lecture notes from the lessons me and my colleagues are attending to. There are some notet and tips for the C++ topics. Some of the lesson notes are not well organized, some of them are not even contain useful information. However still, I tried my best to take notes as much as possible. If there are topics you want to add, or correct some of the parts, please, feel free to do that. I hope it will be useful repository for you :)  

Note:
Up until lesson 31, lecture notes can be read in Resources/C++ Notes.txt file. Because I did not think until lesson 31 that I can make every lecture as a solution file and work with these solutions :D.
